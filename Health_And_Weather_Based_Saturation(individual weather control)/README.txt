Can assign different saturations for each individual weather

I strongly recommend to use alongside with:
   * DX9 Time and Weather Based Bloom and Sunshafts
   * Dynamic Time-based Tonemap Extended

Tips:
   * By pressing "9" (not the numpad) you can view some logs in the console pane by
     pressing "`". Maybe it can help on debugging or reporting some bugs in the Moddb site.

Installation:
   * Extract the archive
   * copy the "gamedata" folder to your Anomaly directory folder

Uninstallation:
   * just delete the "health_and_weather_based_saturation.script" inside
     "<Anomaly Directory Folder>/gamedata/scripts"
