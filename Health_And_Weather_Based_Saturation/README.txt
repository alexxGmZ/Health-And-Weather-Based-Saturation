This addon is mainly designed for Michikos Weather Revamp Revised

This mod assigns saturation level to each weather groups:
* BRIGHT_WEATHERS
	+ w_clear1
	+ w_clear2
	+ w_partly1
* SLIGHTLY_BRIGHT_WEATHER
	+ w_foggy1
	+ w_foggy2
	+ w_rain1
	+ w_partly2
* CLOUDY_WEATHER
	+ w_cloudy1
	+ w_cloudy2_dark
* STORMY_RAINY_WEATHER
	+ w_storm1
	+ w_storm2
	+ w_rain2
	+ w_rain3
* BLOWOUT_PSISTORM_WEATHER
	+ fx_blowout_day
	+ fx_blowout_night
	+ fx_psi_storm_day
	+ fx_psi_storm_night
* UNDERGROUND_MAPS

I strongly recommend to use alongside with:
   * DX9 Time and Weather Based Bloom and Sunshafts
   * Michikos Weather Revamp Revised
   * Dynamic Time-based Tonemap Extended

Tips:
   * By pressing "9" (not the numpad) you can view some logs in the console pane by
     pressing "`". Maybe it can help on debugging or reporting some bugs in the Moddb site.

Installation:
   * Extract the archive
   * copy the "gamedata" folder to your Anomaly directory folder

Uninstallation:
   * just delete the "health_and_weather_based_saturation.script" inside
     "<Anomaly Directory Folder>/gamedata/scripts"
