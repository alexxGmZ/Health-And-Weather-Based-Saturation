This addon dynamically readjust the game saturation(```r__saturation```) in the settings depending on the weather and character health. The Saturation setting will be locked while this mod is installed.
**MCM is supported**

I strongly recommend to use alongside with (budget graphical improvements):

* [DX9 Time and Weather Based Bloom and Sunshafts](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/dx9-time-and-weather-based-bloom-and-sunshafts)
* [Michikos Weather Revamp Revised](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/michikos-weather-revamp-revised)
* [Dynamic Time-based Tonemap Extended](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/dynamic-time-based-tonemap-extended)

<br>

Not currently compatible with:

* [Ayykyu's Screen Effects Modified by Handsome_ooyeah](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/ayykyus-screen-effects-modified-by-handsome-ooyeah2)
