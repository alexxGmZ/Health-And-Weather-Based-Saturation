This version of the addon aims to give more control to each weather saturation through MCM.
Unlike the other one version where the weathers are group into six sets, this version is not.

This addon dynamically readjust the game saturation(```r__saturation```) in the settings
depending on the weather and character health. The Saturation setting will be locked
while this mod is installed.

**MCM is supported**

I strongly recommend to use alongside with (budget graphical improvements):

* [DX9 Time and Weather Based Bloom and Sunshafts](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/dx9-time-and-weather-based-bloom-and-sunshafts)
* [Michikos Weather Revamp Revised](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/michikos-weather-revamp-revised)
* [Dynamic Time-based Tonemap Extended](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/dynamic-time-based-tonemap-extended)

<br>

Not currently compatible with:

* [Ayykyu's Screen Effects Modified by Handsome_ooyeah](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/ayykyus-screen-effects-modified-by-handsome-ooyeah2)
