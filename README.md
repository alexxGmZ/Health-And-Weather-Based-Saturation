### This Addon has two release folders:
* **Health_And_Weather_Based_Saturation**
   + Designed for [Michikos Weather Revamp Revised](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/michikos-weather-revamp-revised)
* **Health_And_Weather_Based_Saturation(individual weather control)**
   + Designed for non Michikos Weather Revamp Revised players
   + Has more control on saturation for each weather

<br>

**MCM is supported**

<br>

I strongly recommend to use alongside with (budget graphical improvements):

* [DX9 Time and Weather Based Bloom and Sunshafts](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/dx9-time-and-weather-based-bloom-and-sunshafts)
* [Michikos Weather Revamp Revised](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/michikos-weather-revamp-revised)
* [Dynamic Time-based Tonemap Extended](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/dynamic-time-based-tonemap-extended)

Tip:
   * By pressing "9" (not the numpad) you can view some logs in the console panel by
     pressing "`". Maybe it can help on debugging or reporting some bugs in the Moddb site.
